  // Some notes on how to compile this.
  // 
  // 1. Understand that for the precondition where q[0..0], it holds vacuously
  //    true because there's no qubit at all.
  //    Implementationwise, I need a way to skip emitting assertions for empty 
  //    ranges
  // 2. With the current semantics, in each iteration, I duplicate both ranges.
  //    This is decided by the fact that q[i .. i+1] is indeed a Had partition.
  // 3. Merge turns to be trickier? 
  //    I need a way to do q[ 0 .. i ]  + q [i .. i + 1] provided that they're 
  //    of different types.
  //    I can use the fact that in the invariant typing q[i .. i + 1] is
  //    adjacent to q[0..i] in entanglement with p[0 .. 10] to make it work so that I just add 0 to one half and
  //    add Pow(i) to another
  // 4. This semantics should be documented seriously for our Dafny 2024
  //    submission.
