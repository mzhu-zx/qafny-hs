#+TITLE: Qafny 2.0



* QuickStart

** Setup
1. Fetch Dafny and Dafny Library

   Both Dafny and its standard library have been included as submodules. Fetch
   them using

   #+begin_src sh
     git submodule init
     git submodule update --recursive 
   #+end_src

   (At this point, Dafny is fixed to =v3.12.0=.)

   <<build_dafny>>
   Installing Dafny is not required,  but one can install it by the following 

   #+begin_src sh
     cd external/dafny/
     make exe
     make z3-ubuntu             # presumably, you use some kind of GNU/Linux
   #+end_src

2. Install Stack and GHC

   It's recommended to use [[https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/][GHCup]] to install GHC and Stack. 

3. Build Qafny

   #+begin_src sh
     stack build
   #+end_src

** Usage

All samples/tests (=<testname>.qfy=) are located in =external/Resources=.

- Compile a single file =<testname>.qfy=

  #+begin_src sh
    stack run -- testname
  #+end_src

- Compile all examples

  #+begin_src sh
    ./runtest.sh
  #+end_src

* How to use Dafny in my editor? 
** Emacs

Use =boogie-friends=.

** Visual Studio Code

There's a Dafny extension available for Code. You will need to configure it to
use the Dafny [[build_dafny][installed]], notably the "Cli Path" option under Extension Settings.

Here are some dependencies required (the exact packages depend on the Linux
distribution you use).

- =dotnet-6.0=
- =aspnet-runtime-6.0=
