#+TITLE: Qafny 2.0
* QuickStart

** Setup
0. Fetch Dafny and Dafny Library

   Both Dafny and its standard library have been included as submodules. Fetch
   them using
   #+begin_src sh
     git submodule init
     git submodule update --recursive 
   #+end_src

   (At this point, Dafny is fixed to =v3.12.0=.)

   Installing Dafny is not required.

1. Install Stack and GHC

   It's recommanded to use [[https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/][GHCup]] to install GHC and Stack. 


2. Build Qafny
   Simply run
   #+begin_src sh
     stack build
   #+end_src

** Usage

All samples/tests (=<testname>.qfy=) are located in =external/Resources=.

- To compile a single file =<testname>.qfy=, run
  #+begin_src sh
    stack run -- testname
  #+end_src

- To compile all examples, run
  #+begin_src sh
    ./runtest.sh
  #+end_src
