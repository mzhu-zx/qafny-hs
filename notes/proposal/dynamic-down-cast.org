* Unsafe Downcast

A saturated =EN= typed locus is actually not entangled at all. Therefore, maybe
downcasted into a =Had= typed locus if that helps.
However, this property must be observed at the verfication time.

When a downcast is specified by a user, the typing stage assumes its validity
with the codegen stage instead generates an assertion to guard that the state
underhood is indeed saturated.
